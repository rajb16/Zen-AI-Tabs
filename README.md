# Zen-AI-Tabs
Hi all, 
I'd like to introduce "Zen AI Tabs". It's a combination of the outdated Gemini AI implementation by  Darsh-A/Ai-TabGroups-ZenBrowser and a Firefox AI only implementation by Vertex-Mods Zen-Tidy-Tabs. 
In this mod you can select between Firefox AI or Google's Gemini AI.
Requirements:  
https://github.com/Vertex-Mods/Advanced-Tab-Groups
https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine
An API key from https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys

Install:
Make sure you have sine and Advanced Tab Groups installed.
Under add your own repo type "rajb16/Zen-AI-Tabs" and hit install
Look for Zen AI Tabs in the sine mods list and click settings
By default, the mod uses the Firefox AI for sorting if you would like to use Gemini please select Gemini in the dropdown menu.
Then input the Gemini API key and the Gemini model you'd like to use. The model I'm currently using is using "gemini-3-flash-preview" and it's the best one so far. 

The clear button should clear any tabs that are not in a tab group or pinned. The sort button is only visible if 2 or more tabs have not been grouped and sorts them into tab groups. 
All credit goes to Darsh-A and Vertex-Mods, as I simply took their projects and combined them.
