# Zen-AI-Tabs
Hi all, 
I'd like to introduce "Zen AI Tabs". It's a combination of the outdated Gemini AI implementation by Darsh-A/Ai-TabGroups-ZenBrowser and a Firefox AI only implementation by Vertex-Mods Zen-Tidy-Tabs. 
In this mod you can select between Firefox AI or Google's Gemini AI.

## Requirements:  
*  https://github.com/Vertex-Mods/Advanced-Tab-Groups
*  https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine
*  An API key from https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys

Install:
*   Make sure you have sine and Advanced Tab Groups installed.
*   Under add your own repo type "rajb16/Zen-AI-Tabs" and hit install.

*   By default, the mod uses the Firefox AI for sorting if you would like to use Gemini please select Gemini in the dropdown menu.
*   Then input the Gemini API key and the Gemini model you'd like to use. The model I'm currently using is using "gemini-3-flash-preview" and it's the best one so far. 

The clear button should clear any tabs that are not in a tab group or pinned. The sort button is only visible if 2 or more tabs have not been grouped and sorts them into tab groups. 
All credit goes to Darsh-A and Vertex-Mods, as I simply took their projects and combined them.
